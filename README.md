# ga-benchmark
This repository is a joint effort to define standards and methodologies for benchmarking Geometric Algebra libraries.

The goal of this project is to help physicists, chemists, engineers and computer scientists to choose the Geometric Algebra library that best suits their practical needs, as well as to push further the improvement of the compared solutions and to motivate the development of new tools.
