# ga-benchmark
This repository is a joint effort to define standards and methodologies for benchmarking Geometric Algebra libraries.

The goal of this project is to assist physicists, chemists, engineers and computer scientists to choose the library that best suits their practical needs, as well as push further the improvement of the compared solutions and motivate the development of new tools.
