# ga-benchmark

## Folder's Description

We suggest that you put in this folder (i.e., `ga-benchmark/libs`) the libraries, library generators, and code optimizers to be compared by the benchmark.

Optionally, the solutions can be placed elsewhere, as long as they can be referenced during CMake's execution.
