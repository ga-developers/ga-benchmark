# ga-benchmark

## Folder's Description
We suggest that you put in this folder (i.e., `ga-benchmark/runs`) the `.ZIP` files including `.JSON` and `.PDF` files generated by the benchmark. See existing `.ZIP` files to deduce the structure of directories. Also, remember to include an `Environment.txt` file describing the used machine, operating system, and compiler.
